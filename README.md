## FAQ ##

*Q*: Metro Chart is already [available on CodePlex](http://modernuicharts.codeplex.com), why copy it here?

*A*: Yes, Metro Chart is available on CodePlex, but development has all but stopped. Mr. Mandelkow, the author, bid a quick farewell in the spring of 2014 and hasn't been available through conventional channels (CodePlex message, Twitter, e-mail).


*Q*: Why not create patches and work on the existing project

*A*: The original author is MIA and not accepting requests. We'll continue work in his stead and continue to try and implement features the community wants.


*Q*: Why GitHub?

*A*: It's a large, vibrant, and ever-growing community and seems to have a better workflow than CodePlex. Just personal opinion, though.
